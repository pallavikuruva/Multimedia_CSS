      <dd>
        Heart disease is a serious health issue that requires early detection to
        reduce risks and complications. The Heart Disease Prediction System is
        developed to analyze patient medical data and predict the possibility of
        heart disease. This project uses health parameters such as age, blood
        pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate to identify risk patterns. The
        system demonstrates how software and data analysis techniques can be
        applied in the healthcare domain. It provides a supportive tool for
        understanding heart health risks and helps software developer freshers
        gain practical experience in solving real-world problems using
        technology.

      <dt><strong>Dataset Description</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The dataset used in this project contains medical records of patients
        collected during heart-related examinations. Each record includes
        attributes such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure,
        cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, and heart rate. These features
        are commonly used to assess heart health. The dataset also includes a
        target field indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. Before
        using the data, preprocessing steps such as cleaning, handling missing
        values, and encoding categorical data are performed to ensure accuracy
        and consistency for model training and evaluation.

      <dt><strong>Methodology</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The methodology begins with data preprocessing, where missing values are
        handled and categorical variables are converted into numerical form. The
        cleaned dataset is then divided into training and testing sets. Machine
        learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression or Decision Tree are
        applied to train the model using the training data. The model learns
        patterns related to heart disease and predicts outcomes for new data.
        Model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics to ensure reliable
        predictions. This systematic approach helps build an efficient and
        understandable prediction system.

      <dt><strong>Results & Conclusion</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The Heart Disease Prediction System provides effective results by
        identifying patients at risk based on medical data. The model achieves
        good accuracy and highlights important factors such as age, cholesterol,
        and blood pressure in predicting heart disease. The results show that
        data-driven approaches can support early risk assessment. In conclusion,
        this project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning
        in healthcare. Although it does not replace medical professionals, it
        serves as a helpful decision-support tool and a valuable learning
        experience for software developer freshers working with real-world
        datasets.
